  <div class="about">
  <p>I am currently a student at Michigan State University studying experience architecture. I got into this field because of my appreciation for design and aesthetics as I’m into fashion, architecture, and nature.
    I think of nature as part of design because I am a golfer; I always find myself looking at the layout of trees, flowers, and bodies of water when playing. My appreciation for nature goes beyond golf, as I have had the opportunity to travel to many places inside and outside of the United States. I find the difference in terrain and culture around the world to be influential. I believe that my background in golf and travel has made me into a very positive and friendly person. Golf is great
because it leads to personal growth; the biggest lesson I’ve taken away from the game is, sometimes you hit your best shot right after your worst. </p> </div>
